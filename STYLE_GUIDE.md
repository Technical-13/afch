Style Guide
========

## CSS
* If a vendor-specific CSS rule is added, please add it for as many different vendors as possible to avoid styling discrepancies between clients.

## Naming conventions
* Regular expressions should be denoted with variable names ending in "_re".
* Function names should be prefixed with "afcHelper_" so as to avoid naming conflicts.

## Other thoughts
* jQuery is not the be all and end all, and, while incredibly useful to the helper script, should still be used only when necessary.

## The code itself
* Source code is indented using *tabs*, not spaces, for reasons unknown to nearly everyone on the development team.
